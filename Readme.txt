This is my submission of an assignment for an Evolutionary Computation module that I took in the CS Honours course. We were provided with a starting point, including the gui setup. 

The code that I wrote is contained in TSP.java (line 126 - 281) and in Chromosome.java (line 128 - 222).

To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the .java files. Compile the Chromosome.java and TSP.java files using "javac [filename]". Then run the program using "java TSP [number of runs] [enable gui]". Any args following the number of runs will enable the gui, while leaving it blank will leave it hidden.
